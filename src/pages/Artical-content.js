          `Create Next.js Application
        For this tutorial, I will use the latest version of Next.js, version 14.2.3, as of April 2024. However, any version starting from 12.0 will be compatible with the steps described.
        
        To create your Next.js application, run the following command. Note that the name of your app, my-app in this example, can be different depending on your preference:
        
        yarn create next-app my-app
        When configuring your application, the choices you make regarding settings might vary. I recommend selecting TypeScript, ESLint, and the app-router to enhance your application's code quality through TypeScript's types, ESLint's linting capabilities, and the modern server-first routing approach provided by the app-router. For more information about the app-router, check out the official Next.js routing documentation.
        
        Configure Next.js
        Once the project files are created, some configuration adjustments are necessary. The main configuration file for your Next.js project might be named next.config.mjs or may differ depending on your setup; however, the content and purpose of the configuration remain consistent across different setups.
        
        In your configuration file, you will add the output property. This setting adjusts the build output to create a standalone folder, which includes only the essential files needed for production deployment, alongside select node_modules files. You can find more details on this setup in the Next.js documentation.`,

      `The last time React released a version was on June 14, 2022, with the version number being 18.2.0. In the field of front-end development, such a slow pace of updates for a popular technology is indeed rare. This has led to dissatisfaction among some influential figures in the community, which I mentioned in my previous article. Those interested can click to view: Disagreements in the React Community.

    Against the backdrop of growing dissatisfaction in the community, news of the new version of React has finally arrived.
    
    The React team has also responded to the criticism of not releasing a new official version for so long: the features previously released to the Canary version, due to their interrelated nature, required the React team to invest a lot of time to ensure they could work together before gradually releasing them to the Stable version.
    
    Indeed, although no official version has been released for nearly two years, the Canary version has seen some significant updates, such as the use, useOptimistic hook, and use client, use server directives. These updates have objectively enriched the React ecosystem, especially promoting the rapid development of full-stack frameworks such as Next.js and Remix.
    
    The React team has confirmed that the next version will be a major release, with the version number being 19.0.0.
    
    Predicting New Features in v19
    Now, let’s take an early look at the new features that might be officially released in version 19, based on the latest news from the React team.
