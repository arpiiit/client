        Every time you write a blog post, you want your readers to take action.
        This action may vary depending on the overall purpose of your blog and
        the specific subject of each individual post. Your goal may be to get
        your reader to subscribe to your blog, to share your post with others,
        to purchase a product, make healthier life decisions, or change their
        views on a particular matter. The possibilities are endless. If you use
        power words in an effective way, you can increase the likelihood that
        your call to action, whatever it may be, will be followed.

      <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
        It takes a bit of practice to learn the most effective ways to include
        power words in your blog posts. If you use too many power words or try
        to evoke an inappropriate level of emotion on a particular topic, that
        can be troublesome for your readers. This is because your writing may
        come off as, emotionally manipulative, overwrought, histrionic, and
        phony. On the other hand, if you don’t use enough power words, or you do
        not take advantage of opportunities to really ‘hit your audience in the
        feels’ when it matters, you may as well ignore power words altogether.

        Two other things that you will need to take into consideration are your
        target audience and your writing style. You don’t want to give your
        audience mental whiplash, for example, by using power words in a way
        that completely changes your writing style. You also don’t want to
        change the tone of your blog in such a way that it puts off your current
        audience. Your use of power words should complement your writing style,
        and appeal to your target demographic. Whatever you do, be sure you
        always use power words correctly. Writing misused words will not get the
        reaction you intend.
